# Expert System Simulation

Simulation of a expert system in a uncertain environment. Basically, you enter the statements/rules which represent the knowledge base of the system, which is used for estimating probability of certain event occuring. You can check the systems progression(step by step, or until end) in a output window. I've also implemented an option of correcting the current rules, as well as an autocorrect for irregular rules.
